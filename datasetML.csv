0+++"The game is great and compaired to other mobile games I've played, it's amazing. It has awesome characters and amazing graphics but there are a few small issues.

0+++The game is fun, I have played it for over a year and ever since I started to now there has been an annoying bug. The bug makes it so that every time after your friend has played a game and send u a msg their status shows up as in game or playing this also happens the other way around this makes it so we can't invite each other unless re open the app and make sure not to msg until we have accepted an invite.+Rated 5 stars out of five stars
0+++This is the most complete moba I played and could be very fun if matched properly. First off characters are not balanced at all. You'll have characters that outperform others especially the new ones wich they release alot. They attempt to nerf some and power up but overall the game still unbalanced. The report system is abused alot of times for stupid reasons like being killed a few times causing players to lose points. Eliminate the physical and magic emblems and let us redeem those points.+Rated 5 stars out of five stars
0+++Game is great time killer with plenty to do. Improvements are always constant. The only thing I have issues with is the limited amount of time of events, and how frequent they are. For harcore players it's okay, but for casual players, it too much, too soon, too quick.+Rated 3 stars out of five stars
0+++It's a great game but matchmaking still sucks you get matched with people of a higher rank then you or a lower rank. The game will match you up with peole.of other regions like Singapore and causes you to lag alot. Moblie legends has not fixed this feature at all! This game is something you should waste on getting or spending money on.+Rated 4 stars out of five stars
0+++Before I love this game so much because it's fun to play, but now it's not. Even if you have good wifi connection it still lags and toxic players. And if our enemy team uses VPN y'all don't even do nothing about it, even if we report. Plus don't forget about the bad matchmaking.....+Rated 1 stars out of five stars
0+++This is by far one of the best mobile games currently out there. If there's anything wrong it gets fixed in no time. Only reason I dont give this game 5 stars is because they have nerfed Zhesk multiple times and it still isn't enough. He is a mence every time I play a game with him in there.+Rated 1 stars out of five stars
0+++I don't know if i was the only one experiencing this. When I open my MLBB app to play, I was so schock because it was on portrait mode. Literally, like the 1/4 part of my phone screen is been covered. I try to reconnect many times but still the same.+Rated 3 stars out of five stars
0+++This game is good but not so good, you know, i have updated this game for so many times. Earlier, I played ranked match and the match was so hard, and when we were losing, the game only crashed and can't open it anymore to defend our base, so of course we lost. Please fix this issue, my phone can still handle it so why would the game always crash and can't open it for several hours? Please fix this issue. This is one of the reason why sometimes I don't wanna play this game anymore.+Rated 1 stars out of five stars
0+++I really love this game.. But i only gave 3 stars because of their really bad matchmaking.. I mean, in Rank Mode, I'm really satisfied about their matchmaking..(Coz when you're 5man, the enemy side is 5man also i love that, kinda thrilling). But in classic mode it really sucks coz if you're mythic you can still be in master rank. IT SUCKS. Coz they can easily outplay the game.+Rated 2 stars out of five stars
0+++I really like the game, but I kind of annoyed with the connection. I have a strong internet connection yet the ping still shows yellow or red. I can't play well. My games are always delay. I don't know anymore which one has the problem. Please fix this one.+Rated 3 stars out of five stars
0+++However, sometimes it lag. The internet connection is also annoying, when playing it turned red but when my hero died, the connection turned green. I hope this can be fixed. Its so frustrating, the matching too. But because i enjoy it. I will gave 5 stars.+Rated 2 stars out of five stars
0+++It's good but it certain things are stupid. Apparently losing connection for any reason is considered as an offense and in turn you get banned from matchmaking. Would've been better if you could appeal for getting unbanned for a valid reason. But no guess that's not possible.+Rated 5 stars out of five stars
0+++I don't like how ML and Montoon pair us with enemies higher than our levels. We should be paired up with enemies of equal levels and whose teammates with equal stats as us. Enemies can even use cheats during the game to speed up their levels , experience, gold and equipments. Such a bad app. You always lose and you can barely win when you rank up. Really hate it.+Rated 3 stars out of five stars
0+++The game itself is awesome but the only problem is that the making matches of the game especially in classic mode is really unfair, it should be epic vs epic not elite vs mythic.., I've been played MLBB for almost 4 years but now I'm so disappointed about too many AFK players, cheaters, hackers & feeders in the game. I hope the developer of this game (Moonton) will not only focus on just making skins of heroes. Skin are useless because it's skin attributes are too little in stats like dmg & hp_,+Rated 1 stars out of five stars
0+++Could be great, however the toxic community and horrible matchmaking and unbalanced heroes ruin this game. They will release a hero make extremely OP to encourage your purchase and then after you buy then nerf them... No matter how high you climb trolls run this game. Stick to any other MOBA and you'll probably be happier. Moontoon does not care about your problems or issues with the game. Everyone: Fix matchmaking!!!!! Moontoon: Let's add a useless skin because screw our players!+Rated 2 stars out of five stars
0+++A good game ruined by insane ammounts of bloat. Just starting the game is a chore of closing pop-up window after pop-up window. The ammount of different currencies for different stuff is just too much. Pick one and stick to it, or add an autoclaim function.+Rated 1 stars out of five stars

0+++This game is good over all. It's only 1 star short because I have a problem with the way they handle afk players. My dad tends to interrupt me when matchmaking cause its dinnertime. Yall need to realize people also have lives to live. If they are afk because they have to do something real quick, they should not be penalized.+Rated 1 stars out of five stars
0+++This game is very very good I used to give it 5 stars but now I give just 3 stars because I can't get in the game when I going to open the game : the moonton appeared and then nothing appered again many times I tried to open it but I cant. I dont understand why? I fixed this by restarted my phone but It not work .TT+Rated 4 stars out of five stars
0+++The reason why I give it a 1 star ,if could give 0 star I will give it.Because they only focus on how to make money they didn't fix the matchmaking,sometimes I play with noob player while our opponents are well-trained ,it's ok to lose with professional player but to lose with noob teammates that will be worst.I will say last thing don't focus on how to gain money focus on what the players suggest. I hope you will read this concern about your game...+Rated 3 stars out of five stars
0+++it could have been the best game,, this app can control the match making... ranking up is hard in the long run... it might be the purchases,, my other account got mythic , but the other with no purchase at all, always lose. is that a coincidence? well ,,, i can say , i didnt believe on the comments here before..+Rated 1 stars out of five stars
0+++Players/team is very unbalanced in every match especially in rank games and very unfair for me and all players. There are a lot of players playing this game, but the teammates some of us are having are weak, blaming others for own mistakes, intentional feeding and throwing of match, and many more problems that concerns all players who experienced these like me. Another thing is the exploits on a lot of heroes that needs to be nerfed to the ground. Focus on balancing the game not skins and events+Rated 1 stars out of five stars
0+++The report system is ridiculous whether you've committed a violation or not you can be muted, or banned. Every skin event while the skins and animations might be cool it doesn't matter cause its going to cost you a few hundred bucks to get just one of the exclusives at a time. When the game is more about skin design and less about performance, matchmaking balance or lag issues. Hackers or vpn. It's silly+Rated 3 stars out of five stars
0+++Matchmaking got worse with the new update. If you're one of the above average player in a team while you teammates are poor players, you end up getting nerfed. But if its the opposite, you get buffed. however, it is useless in the end, because if you're in the team of the first scenario, you are matched to fight the ones in the second scenario. Which makes the matchmaking very unfair. Nothing change, matchmaking buff/debuff is very unfair. Wild Rift has better matchmaking algorithm.+Rated 1 stars out of five stars
0+++I must say that this game is nice although I have one problem about this game can you do something about this game? Which always lagging whenever I play, and yes I have checked my wifi and it's not the problem I tried turning my data and wifi at the same time and it still lagging getting revamped heroes are cool but please be concerning about this problem I know that some players are compalinin about this problem, it has been 3 weeks that it's been lagging I can't even play a ranked game+Rated 1 stars out of five stars

0+++Good game, but since the update lag has become very commonplace, and the community is quite toxic... when they are lagging they expect people to be understanding, yet when others lag they curse them to the skies... since the goal of playing a game is to have fun, this game doesn't fulfil that with the ridiculous lag and toxic community.+Rated 2 stars out of five stars

0+++- ARCADE CHESS: Could be fun but Benny has a OP ability that makes it suck playing against benny users. - Arcade Arena: High potential just needs massive attention to add units and such. - Whole main menu and stuff needs change it feels old. - You won't get the best reward in any event or offer unless you pay for everything even if it says chance to get before it never will so plan on going all in. - Awesome game but is not doing future planning well it seems like it's scattered and random.+Rated 1 stars out of five stars
0+++Game would be fun if.. Heroes would be balanced... Get ur 30k bp or 600 cr. hero and u will be more op then rest of cheaper heroes... Devs are too money focused to make this game actualy good and balanced... And its stupid that cheaper heroes from start till end game does way less dmg... 30k bp heroes has even 10times better abilities so that means if u are new at game and f2p you can forget high rank... couse this game is balanced on heroes you pick instead of ur skill in game.

0+++"More new heroes and skins. Moneyton hungry for more money. Never want to fix the matchmaking algo. Bad report system, basically useless. Im a glory 800+ points and still unhappy with the matchmaking system. The more winrate u hve, the most likely u will team up with a player who have no clue.

0+++"too many unskilled players being matched poorly. either you get teammates with bad internet, bat attitude or bad skills - worse if all these, 8/10 of the time and admin doesn't penalize enough because they are afraid they will lose players you dont get enough rewards for playing well - even if you play well regularly skins too expensive and ""epic"" skins are using gatcha mechanic skins you get for free are ones that are outdated new heroes are becoming boring"+Rated 1 stars out of five stars

0+++This game cheats on its players. Matching algorithm is rigged to win the other team and lose the other. If the prediction algorithm is deemed incorrect, it goes to second cheat mechanism, the fps drops and ms spikes. Don't play rank is you don't have the stomach to go on a losing streak and then win afterwards. All is rigged in rank. Your efforts are just food to those who pay.+Rated 1 stars out of five stars

0+++Game like game is super. Problem is that , when you buy a hero, they search from you to play 2 brawl games to unlock hero for ranked and other. You will say, ohh, that's easy, i didn't see anything bad in that. But, brawl mode is mode when they give you two random chacaters, and you need to pick up one of two. Like draft in some way... If you are not lucky, they wouldn't give you hero in 100 games, and probaly you lost time for nothing. Game is cool, maybe to add 2 or 3 ranks more.+Rated 1 stars out of five stars

I'm not gonna play this game anymore very very trash update.+Rated 3 stars out of five stars

0+++Fix your matchmaking, Random matchmaking sucks. I'm surprised a lot of people still play this trash game. Matchmaking is garbage. Solo players should not be mixed with duos and trios. Match making is designed so that high winrate players are mixed with low winrate players, it sucks especially in highrank games. Fix your matchmaking.+Rated 1 stars out of five stars
0+++The problem with MLBB is that in ranked players get to play whatever they want. This results in teams having two markman, two mages, or two fighters. This causes alot games to be hard on users that knows how to play and wants to win. I would recommend that players select a role before queuing up. I believe this will create a healthy environments for players that enjoy playing ranked. Thank you!+Rated 1 stars out of five stars

Second the skins, literally this is what people mostly hates All the skins costs so MUCH? Like there is no so much effects? How is that worth it? Thirdly the miya users hated. Limited miya costs much right? That is super so not worth it, It's the same effects🤦, I would greatly appreciate if you fix this, Thanks in advance lol😕.+Rated 3 stars out of five stars
0+++Stupid game for stupid gamers. For kids only if you want to play a MOBA where teamwork and cooperation is not your thing then this game is for you. Everyone wants to get buffs and it is pay-to-win or simply a gacha game where you spend 15k pesos to get a single skin that is trash just like this game. Also the community itself is toxic and they think that MLBB is the best MOBA in the whole world but they didn't know that only two countries hypes this game.

First of all I sometimes get a very high and unplayable ping but I can handle with that at times.

0+++It used to be a good game until the devs focus so much on the graphics. Unless your phone has a snapdragon chipset, don't bother installing this game. I am telling you, even Helio 80 chipset (xiaomi redmi 9) can't handle this game. It will lag and freeze especially in magic chess. It will just stress you out.

0+++Overall the game is great! However, I would suggest the developer to rethink about the deduction of credit score when someone is AFK due to lost internet connection, as we players can't expect when we will encountered such situation. Maybe players that went AFK due to lost connection can regain all their deducted scores after 3-4 matches after that. I don't know, it is just my suggestion.+Rated 1 stars out of five stars
